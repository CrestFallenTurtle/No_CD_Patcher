# No CD Patcher
There has been too many times were crappy CD-readers successfully destroy one of our valuable games.
<b>This has to stop.</b><br>

That's where this project comes into play, the goal is to patch out the requirement for a CD to be present when running certain games.

The point will never be to distribute cracked `.exe` files, but in rather produce a program that can patch it out for you if you meet the requirements set by each project.

### Patchers that currently exist
