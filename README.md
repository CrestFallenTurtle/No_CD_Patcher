# No CD Patcher

The goal with these smaller projects found in the repository is patch out the requirement for a cd when running those games.<br>
The point will never be to distribute cracked `.exe` files, but in rather produce a program that can patch it out for you if you meet the requirements set by each project.

### Patchers that currently exist
